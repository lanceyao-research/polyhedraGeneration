# polyhedraGeneration
MATLAB codes for generating projection images of polyhedra.  
The codes requires the MATLAB version of astra-toolbox https://github.com/astra-toolbox/astra-toolbox. A copy of the version I used (1.9.0) could be found in this repository.  
Seven script files used for generating different polyhedra are included: cube, coreshell cube, octahedron, triangular prism, tetrahedron, tetrahexahedron, and random polydron. Those shapes account for the most common nanoparticles encountered in synthesis and self-assembly. The generation codes considers randomness indlucing random orientation, size distribution and vertex roundess.
The output includes projection images and their corresponding volumetric imagees. The total number of generated image pairs could be adjusted in the script. The folders should first be created before running the codes.
