# polyhedraGeneration
MATLAB codes for generating projection images of polyhedra.  
The codes requires the MATLAB version of astra-toolbox https://github.com/astra-toolbox/astra-toolbox. A copy of the version I used (1.9.0) could be found in this repository.  
Seven script files used to generating different polyhedra are included: cube, coreshell cube, octahedron, triangular prism, tetrahedron, tetrahexahedron, and random polydron. Those shapes account for the common nanoparticles encountered in synthesis and self-assembly. The generation codes considers randomness indlucing random orientation, size distribution and vertex roundess.
